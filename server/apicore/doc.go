/*
Package apicore is a package which holds all the building blocks used to structure and
implement the API provided by BlapChat.

It is kept separate from the implementation of the BlapChat API. This is b/c the
system structure behind the API is actually quite useful. And can be applied to
other projects.

Given some extra time it is my (Noah Huppert) wish that this package will be
split into a separate, more general, repo.
